                        <div class="blog-post-content">
                            <p>PhonePad needs clear goals and milestones for it's launch. It works, but it's not
                                awesome. Yes, i plan to release it for testing at some point, but it's not there yet. In
                                this post you can see the big picture, the vision i want PhonePad to be. First, the
                                alpha releases:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    PhonePad 0.1 Alpha: the first release, which is <a href="/index.html">already
                                        available</a> at the publication of this article, is a basic version that allows
                                    you to use your
                                    phone as a controller. It works, but it lacks many features. The goal is to make it
                                    stable and functional, but not perfect.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    PhonePad 0.2 Alpha: focused on layout customization. It will allow
                                    you to change the layout of the controller, add (or remove) buttons, and customize
                                    the look and feel of the app. I also plan on enabling the PhonePad Server to change
                                    the layout of the app, so you can customize it from your PC or change it depending
                                    on the game.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    PhonePad 0.3 Alpha: focused on visual identity and user experience. This update
                                    will bring new designs, more aligned with the website. I plan in adding the
                                    option to choose the controller background, personalizing it to your liking. You
                                    will be able to change the background from the Server as well. At last, this update
                                    will feature a new UI to the Server, making it easier for peaple to understand and
                                    use it.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    PhonePad 0.4 Alpha: this update will focus on motion controll features. They were
                                    present before, but disabled temporarily due to bugs. The goal is to enable them
                                    again, and add some new features like better config page and mapping
                                    movements/gestures to buttons.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>PhonePad 0.5 Alpha: the last alpha version, will bring the option for you to connect
                                    using QR code and the ability to share / import layouts and the onboarding screens.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                After the alphas, we will have some few beta versions. The goal is to test, fix and
                                slowly ship the app to stores.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    PhonePad 0.9 Beta: stability and bug fixing.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    PhonePad 1.0 Beta 1: Fixing the last touches before shipping the Android app, like
                                    adding ads to the app, icons, etc. This version will be shipped to
                                    Play Store for testing. Finishing touches on PhonePad Server before shipping to MS
                                    Store. More fixes and stability.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    PhonePad 1.0 Beta 2: focus on the Server, fixing anything that may have come across
                                    along the way. This version will be shipped to Steam for testing.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>After all this work, i will confidently launch PhonePad 1.0. It seems distant, but i like
                                to think that it's closer than we think. The work is also not going to stop there, as i
                                have many other features planned, like multiplayer, macros, action mapping and so on.
                                This is just a start.

                        SIDU is the Open Source connection library
                        that powers PhonePad. You can use it to
                        make connections between PCs and phones, like games that use PhonePad as a controller option.
                        Releasing soon.
