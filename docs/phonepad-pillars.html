                        <p class="blog-post-date">07/28/2025</p>
                        <div class="blog-post-content">
                            <p>
                                PhonePad is a dream comming true, and i have great plans for it. I want to keep
                                improving, adding new features and making it the best phone controller app out there.
                                This is a bold statement, since others are 10 years of development ahead, but it's
                                possible.
                            </p>
                            <p>The ultimate goal of PhonePad is to be a new way of playing your PC games. An alternative
                                to mouse/keyboard/controller, not just an "controller emulator" that you use only when
                                you don't have any other way of playing your game. You should have a reason to PREFER
                                playing on PhonePad instead of the default options.</p>
                            <p>
                                To achieve this, there are 5 pillars that need to be developed, lots of bugs and
                                quality of life features. These pillars will make PhonePad stand out among other apps,
                                and are
                                the following:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Customizable app and controls.</li>
                                <li>Distinct look and feel.</li>
                                <li>Easy of use.</li>
                                <li>Community based.</li>
                                <li>Make PhonePad a platform for games that use it as a controller.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Customization and controls</h3>
                            <p>Games need to be good to play. They need to be precise, responsive, and PhonePad lacks
                                a lot of features in this sense. Playing on a phone screen is restrictive, so you can't
                                do much if
                                you're unable to customize your layout and the behavior of the buttons.</p>
                            <p>To handle this, we have the first pillar: the app must be customizable to suit most games
                                needs. Features should be added so players don't feel penalized for playing on a
                                mobile phone instead of an actual controller.</p>
                            <p>The features i have planned for this are the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The button placements, size and appearence can
                                    be customized.</li>
                                <li>You can change what the button does or if it maps to a key on the
                                    controller or a key on the keyboard/mouse.</li>
                                <li>You can have a button triggering a series of actions all at once.</li>
                                <li>You can map actions to your phone buttons.</li>
                                <li>You can make PhonePad listen to your physical phone controller inputs instead of
                                    screen presses.</li>
                                <li>You can use motion controls and movements as inputs to games that don't support it
                                    natively.</li>
                                <li>Your can have macros.</li>
                                <li>The game can change your layout on the fly.</li>
                                <li>Multiplayer support.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>First, those features aim to reduce the "i didn't mean to press that" and the "my input
                                was not
                                recognized", providing ways to reduce any stress that
                                playing on a mobile device instead of a controller can cause.</p>
                            <p>Second, they try to add new, inovative ways of playing. Like steering in a racing game by
                                rotating your phone, jumping by shaking it, making easy combos in fight games by
                                using macros, and many other interactions.</p>

                            <h3>Distinct look and feel</h3>
                            <p>PhonePad has a very distinct visual identity in the website, but not in the app itself or
                                in the server. I'm planning to add the website's visual to the app some point in the
                                future, and i believe this is one of the things that will atract peaple.</p>

                            <h3>Easy of use</h3>
                            <p>PhonePad requires an server running and a driver to be installed in your PC. This is not
                                trivial for most peaple, and we need to find ways to mitigate this. Also, the app/server
                                distribution needs to be easy, and the onboarding process needs to be
                                simple and intuitive.
                                Here some ideas:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Games should be able to connect with PhonePad directly in order to bypass the
                                    need for drivers/controller emulation.</li>
                                <li>The driver could be optional, defaulting to keyboard/mouse emulation if they're not
                                    present/broken.</li>
                                <li>PhonePad Server could be listed on Steam or Microsoft Store for
                                    convenience.</li>
                                <li>Both the app and the server need to be easy to use. And them EASIER.</li>
                                <li>App and Server should have an good documentation and easy onboarding.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This is all about not stressing the user when first downloading the app/server. I don't
                                have any means of signing the Server, so distributing it via Microsoft Store and
                                Steam will give users the trust needed to not close the app away when facing the
                                "Windows protected your PC" screen.</p>
                            <h3>Community based</h3>
                            <p>I want this project to resonate with a community, generating contributions, sharing
                                custom layouts or discussing new features. I wish this project becomes bigger than me, i
                                truly do. So please, if you have any ideas, suggestiongs, willing to contribute or help
                                in any way, reach out to me! I can't pay or even promisse anything for now, but it would
                                be nice to have more peaple around.</p>
                            <p>Also, the project has a restrictive license in a way: you can modify the code,
                                contribute,
                                build and use it yourself, but you can't pick the code and
                                reupload/redistribute. That's the rule for now, but i do know that this may push away
                                contributors, specially because i plan to have ads in the app. It's not fair that i will
                                be gaining money from the free labour of good willing peaple, so rest assured that i'm
                                open to ideas in this area. I could recompensate contributors for their work in the
                                future if the app make any money, or something like this.</p>
                            <h3>A platform to games</h3>
                            <p>PhonePad is powered by SIDU, a connection framework. I also plan in open-sourcing SIDU in
                                the future and creating bidings for many languages and game engines. All of this with a
                                simple goal in mind: making easy for games to connect with PhonePad. SIDU will be much
                                more generic, of course. You will not need to use PhonePad if you don't want to, but it
                                should work out of the box.</p>
                            <p>This means that in the future, we may have games that say "Hey, this game is
                                compatible with PhonePad". The user would be able to open PhonePad and simply connecting
                                to the game directly, without the need for the PhonePad Server or drivers.</p>
                            <p>For this to work, SIDU needs to be really good, easy to use and compatible with most game
                                engines. I'll work hard so PhonePad can be used by as many games as i can!</p>
